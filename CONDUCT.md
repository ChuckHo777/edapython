# Contributor Code of Conduct
## Values
We want to make our team productive, supportive, open and friendly to provide a safe space for all members to foster good working relationships and friendships. Besides respect and honesty, we value individual's opinions, time and efforts, regardless of race, religion, nationality, age, gender, gender identity and orientation, personal appearance, body size, level of experience, or disability. Additionally, we believe that diversity makes our team more creative and fun. Each week, team members rotate roles among the leader, scribe, and proof-reader so that everyone is involved and responsible for team activities.

#### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
-	Be inclusive and polite in communication either in person or online.
-	Be friendly and generous when giving or accepting criticisms.
-	Be collaborative and supportive.
-	Respect other team members' opinions and work.
-	Respect the teamwork distribution and schedule.
-	Communicate with other members in time if encounter any difficulties.
-	Be responsible for the team role and distributed work.
-	Be aware that other team members may have different backgrounds and expertise.

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
-	Personal attacks, threats or insults.
-	Unexpected recording or photography.
-	Discriminatory comments, behaviors, or images.
-	Publishing other's work or information without permission.
-	Disrupting other's talk too much.
-	Ignore the responsibility for the distributed work or the team role.
-	Ignore the deadline or the team activity schedule.

## Consequences for unacceptable behavior
-	Members who are asked to stop acceptable behaviors should comply immediately.
-	If a member violates this code of conduct, other team members have the right to stop or report unacceptable behaviors.

## Reporting a problem
The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. If the problem is within the project team, the first step is to talk to other team members and discuss the problem first. If the problem cannot be solved within the team, then team members can report the problem to a member of the teaching team or the course instructor.

Project team members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
