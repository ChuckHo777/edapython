# Contributions and Feedback
We welcome any feedback, bug reports and/or contributions to this project via the Github Repository! By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct.

### Notice bugs or have comments and requests
If you notice bugs or have comments or requests, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/edapython/issues). We'll review the issue within 5 working days.

### How to make contributions or fix the bugs
Project members and contributors are expected to follow Github Flow by creating their own branch and submitting a Pull Request to the master branch to make any changes. All code should be written in PEP8 Style and contain tests. 

Step 1: Clone the GitHub repository:
- `git clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/edapython.git`

Step 2: Create a new branch and switch to it:
- `git checkout -b <branch_name>`

If you already have an active branch, update it first before you make any changes.
- `git pull origin master` to pull changes
- `git checkout  <branch_name>` to checkout branch
- `git merge master` to merge changes
- `git push origin <branch>` to push the updated branch to the remote

Step 3: Commit your changes to your branch:
- `git add 'your changed file'`
- `git commit -m 'your changed file'`

Step 4: Push the changes to the master branch:
- `git push origin <branch_name>`

Step 5: Submit a pull request (PR) on GitHub asking to merge your branch into the master branch. 

All merges require approval from an admin member. For details on creating a PR, please see GitHub documentation [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Please write details in the pull request including the motivation and purpose of your commit as well as a description of the changes. We will review the pull requests within 5 working days and you will get feedback in the PR discussion if anything needs to be changed.
